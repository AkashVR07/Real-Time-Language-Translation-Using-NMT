# Real-Time-Language-Translation-Using-NMT
This Python project implements a Real-Time Multi-Language Translator with a graphical interface using Kivy. It leverages the Hugging Face MarianMT models (Helsinki-NLP) for neural machine translation. Unlike the command-line version, this project provides an interactive desktop GUI where users can select a target language, load the appropriate model, type input text, and view translations in real-time.

# Features
* üñ•Ô∏è Graphical Interface built with Kivy (modern and user-friendly).
* üåç Supports translation from English ‚Üí multiple languages.
* üöÄ Uses Hugging Face MarianMT models for high-quality translations.
* ‚ö° Real-time translation as users type.
* üîß Clear status updates (Ready, Loading, Translating, Error).
* üîí Source language fixed to English (simplifies usage).
* üé® Custom-styled dropdowns and text display for a smooth UI.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have installed:
* Python 3.7 or higher
Required Python packages:
* transformers
* torch
* kivy

# Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
```pip install transformers torch kivy```
3. Ensure you have a stable internet connection (to download MarianMT models from Hugging Face when loading the translator).

# Usage
Run the translator app with:
```python main.py```
Steps:
1. Launch the app ‚Äî the window opens with Source Language fixed to English.
2. Select your Target Language from the dropdown list.
3. Click "Load Translation Model" (this downloads and loads the MarianMT model).
4. Type your text in the input box ‚Äî translations will appear in real-time.
5. View status updates (Ready, Translating, Complete, or Error) at the bottom.

Example

* Source Language: English
* Target Language: French
* Input: "Hello, how are you?"
* Output: "Bonjour, comment √ßa va ?"
